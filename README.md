# 3-to-do-lists 1.0.0
To-Do-Lists coded in 3 different languages (Angular/Typescript, React, Vue)

## To-Do-List in Angular, React & Vue


Project was made for doing some skill check and training, doing the same task (build a to-do-list app) in different languages.

Started out with Angular, which I haven't tried before, and doing the same projects again.

Things that still are open to do are:

- React list has no back-end, struggled with that

- Vue had an visual queue for completed tasks, didn't really worked yet as the whole list got marked as completed


update will eventually come
